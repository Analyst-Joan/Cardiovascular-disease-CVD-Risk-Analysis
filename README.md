![CVD Dashboard Overview](CVD_Dboard_Homepg.png)

## Business Problem

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading public health concern, yet many healthcare stakeholders lack clear insights to **identify high-risk patients early** and implement targeted prevention strategies.
This limits proactive care, efficient resource allocation, and data-driven insurance policy design.

## Target Audience
-	Technical and Non-technical Healthcare stakeholders

## Objective

* Identify high-risk CVD patient groups using demographic and clinical data
* Analyze the impact of lifestyle factors on cardiovascular risk
* Deliver actionable insights for healthcare and insurance stakeholders

**Key KPIs**

* CVD prevalence rate
* Risk distribution by age and gender
* BMI and hypertension relationship
* Blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose trends

## Dataset

* **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)
* **Key Fields:**
  * Age, Gender
  * BMI
  * Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose
  * Lifestyle factors (Smoking, Alcohol use, Physical activity)
  * CVD diagnosis / risk indicators

## Tools Used
* Microsoft Excel
  * Power Query
  * Pivot Tables
  * Power Pivot (Data Modellling & KPI measures)

## Analysis Approach

* Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query
* Built relationships and KPI measures with Power Pivot
* Analyzed demographic, lifestyle, and clinical risk patterns
* Designed an interactive Excel dashboard with slicers and pivot charts

## Key Insights

* **49% of assessed patients had CVD**, with the highest burden among **women aged 50–59**
* **Males and individuals aged 60–64** showed the highest overall CVD risk
* **Overweight patients** exhibited a strong link to hypertension
* **Smokers and alcohol consumers** recorded elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose

## Recommendations

* **Healthcare Administrators:** Implement targeted prevention programs for high-risk demographics
* **Physicians & Medical Teams:** Prioritize proactive screening and early intervention for patients aged **50+**
* **Insurance Partners:** Apply risk-based segmentation to adjust premiums and introduce wellness incentives

## Deliverables

* Interactive Excel CVD Dashboard
* Video walkthrough of dashboard insights
