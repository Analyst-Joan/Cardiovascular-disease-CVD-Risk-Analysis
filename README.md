## Business Problem

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading public health concern, yet many healthcare stakeholders lack clear insights to **identify high-risk patients early** and implement targeted prevention strategies.
This limits proactive care, efficient resource allocation, and data-driven insurance policy design.

## Target Audience
-	Technical and Non-technical Healthcare stakeholders

## Objective

* Identify high-risk CVD patient groups using demographic and clinical data
* Analyze the impact of lifestyle factors on cardiovascular risk
* Deliver actionable insights for healthcare and insurance stakeholders

**Key KPIs**

* CVD prevalence rate
* Risk distribution by age and gender
* BMI and hypertension relationship
* Blood pressure, cholesterol, and glucose trends

## Dataset

* **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset)
* **Key Fields:**
  * Age, Gender
  * BMI
  * Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose
  * Lifestyle factors (Smoking, Alcohol use, Physical activity)
  * CVD diagnosis / risk indicators

## Tools Used
